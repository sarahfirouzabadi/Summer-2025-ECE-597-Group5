## Project Title
**Unveiling Phishing Patterns through Machine Learning**

## Overview

Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations. This capstone project addresses this challenge by developing a machine learning (ML) model capable of detecting phishing emails

## Objectives
- Analyze email subject lines and body content using ML algorithms.
- Identify distinguishing features and patterns in phishing emails.
- Visualize findings to enhance interpretability and promote phishing awareness.
- Train ML classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluate models using AUC, confusion matrix, and balanced accuracy.
- Integrate advanced embedding-based models for improved semantic understanding.
